# file-cycle

This package allows you to cycle through files with the same name but different extension. This is useful for example when you have

- foo.js
- foo.css
- foo.html

If there are no files with the same name but different extension, it will just cycle through the files in the same folder.

## Default keymap

- `alt-p` will go to the next file alphabet wise
- `alt-shift-p` will go to the next file anti-alphabet wise
